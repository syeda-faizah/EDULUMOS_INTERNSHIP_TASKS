## Getting Started

To run the Jupyter Notebook:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>

Install dependencies: pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib

Open the notebook: jupyter notebook Task_04_Titanic_EDA.ipynb

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis focuses on identifying survival patterns based on:

Gender

Age

Passenger Class

Socio-economic factors

## Visualizations Included

Survival counts

Survival by gender

Survival by class

Age distribution

Correlation heatmap

## Advanced Analysis 

Additional engineered features were explored such as:

FamilySize – total family members aboard

IsAlone – whether the passenger was traveling alone

Titles – extracted from passenger names

These features helped uncover deeper survival patterns beyond basic demographics.

## Key Insights 

Females and first-class passengers had higher survival rates

Younger passengers had better survival chances

Fare and social factors influenced survival outcomes
